|Rational|SIDAN Lab is voting to abstain from the info action Should K Increases as this governance action records information on-chain without producing any direct on-chain effects.

Remark:

If the proposed increase in parameter k is a protocol parameter changes governance action, it is expected to have the following effects:

- Stake pools will reach saturation more quickly, increasing the likelihood of ADA migration to smaller stake pools.
- The creation of new stake pools will improve the network's decentralization.
- Rewards received by stake pools will decrease, potentially impacting the incentives and sustainability of stake pool operators.

Considering all these factors, SIDAN Lab will continue to review and closely monitor stake pool parameters, network decentralization, operating costs, and rewards. A decision will be made when the community initiates a governance action for protocol parameter changes.
