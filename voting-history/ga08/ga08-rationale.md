| Rational       | SIDAN Lab is voting YES on governance action Decrease Treasury Tax from 20% to 10%. Below are the key reasons supporting this decision: |

Optimizing Treasury Management & Budget Efficiency

- The Cardano treasury has accumulated significant funds, yet there is no proven track record of effective fund utilization. Without a clear, efficient use of treasury funds, continuing to accumulate excessive reserves is unnecessary
- Taxation should be set at the minimum level necessary to sustain the network while ensuring proper allocation of resources

Enhancing Staking Incentives & Network Security

- Increasing staking rewards encourages more ADA holders to participate in staking, reinforcing network decentralization and security
- A higher return on staking could attract new users to Cardano, strengthening overall ecosystem growth
- This change promotes a sustainable and decentralized governance model, ensuring that resources are distributed efficiently rather than centralized in the treasury

By reducing the treasury cut to 10%, we strike a better balance between staking incentives and treasury sustainability.
