| Rational       | SIDAN Lab is voting NO on governance action “Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget - 275M ada Administered by Intersect” |

- **Too large and bundled**

39 proposals combined in one GA limits DRep discretion. We support some, not all.

- **Sets risky precedent**

Approving this signals that we’re comfortable with large, bundled budgets before proving the effectiveness of constitutional governance. DReps may have supported it to avoid blocking the budgeting process, rather than out of genuine support for a high spending limit.

We acknowledge the efforts Intersect has made and recognize its role within the ecosystem. However, based on past performance, there remain areas where execution has not fully aligned with community expectations. While we believe Intersect is continuing to grow in capacity and experience, we have reservations about its current readiness to administer a budget of this size and complexity effectively.
