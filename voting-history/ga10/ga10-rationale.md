| Rational       | SIDAN Lab will vote NO on this proposal—not because we disagree with its intent, but because we believe that including 2026 at this stage is premature. |

We fully support the rationale behind setting a Net Change Limit (NCL) for 2025. Cardano’s governance and funding systems are still maturing, and setting a hard cap a full year in advance limits flexibility without the benefit of real-world learning from 2025.
We are also concerned that including a second year:

- Complicates implementation and creates constitutional uncertainty if multiple NCL proposals pass.
- May unintentionally lock us into figures that are no longer appropriate when 2026 planning begins.

We encourage a revised proposal that:

- Focuses on 2025 alone, based on current conditions and treasury projections.
- Defers the 2026 limit for a separate governance action, informed by actual data and ecosystem needs.
