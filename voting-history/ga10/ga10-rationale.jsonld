    "comment": "SIDAN Lab will vote NO on this proposal—not because we disagree with its intent, but because we believe that including 2026 at this stage is premature.\n\nWe fully support the rationale behind setting a Net Change Limit (NCL) for 2025. Cardano’s governance and funding systems are still maturing, and setting a hard cap a full year in advance limits flexibility without the benefit of real-world learning from 2025.\n\nWe are also concerned that including a second year:\n- Complicates implementation and creates constitutional uncertainty if multiple NCL proposals pass.\n- May unintentionally lock us into figures that are no longer appropriate when 2026 planning begins.\n\nWe encourage a revised proposal that:\n- Focuses on 2025 alone, based on current conditions and treasury projections.\n- Defers the 2026 limit for a separate governance action, informed by actual data and ecosystem needs."
