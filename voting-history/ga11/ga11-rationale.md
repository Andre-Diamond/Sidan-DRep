| Rational       | SIDAN Lab has chosen to abstain from voting on the 350M ADA Net Change Limit (NCL) proposal for 2025. |

We recognize and agree with many of the key arguments in favor of this proposal:

- Sell pressure concerns are likely overstated, as treasury disbursement and proposal execution occur in phases over time.
- Setting an NCL is essential to unlock treasury funding and enable proposal review and budgeting under the new governance model.. A delayed NCL or failed vote could cause a 60-day funding freeze, stalling community innovation and disproportionately benefiting large entities with early proposal traction.

At the same time, we share several concerns raised by those who voted NO:

- We believe more governance infrastructure is needed—including clearer treasury oversight, tracking, and community visibility—before approving higher NCLs.

A Yes vote could be seen as endorsing the current treasury governance structure without addressing its known shortcomings.
A No vote could unintentionally delay needed funding, harming the same community builders we aim to support.
Given the above, SIDAN Lab is abstaining as a signal that:

- We value progress and funding continuity, but also expect clearer NCL modeling and stronger oversight mechanisms in future treasury actions.
- We will continue participating actively in treasury governance discussions, and support community-led initiatives to improve transparency, accountability, and access to funding.
