| Rational       | SIDAN Lab is voting YES on the proposal to set a 300M ADA Net Change Limit (NCL) for Epochs 563â€“635. |

ðŸŸ¦ **Not ideal, but better than 350M**

The previously approved 350M ADA NCL felt excessive given the current state of oversight. 300M ADA is still high, but more aligned with expected treasury inflows and far less aggressive. It reflects some moderation.

ðŸŸ¦ **200M proposal was our first choice â€” but it didnâ€™t pass**

We previously supported the 200M NCL because it promoted discipline and encouraged focused spending. But with that option off the table, 300M is the more cautious choice left.

ðŸŸ¦ **One-year scope makes sense**

A fixed 12-month window provides predictability for proposers while allowing the community to reassess and adjust before locking in the future.

ðŸŸ¦ **Governance is still early**

Until we see stronger safeguards or maturity, lower limits should be the default.
