| Rational       | SIDAN Lab votes No on 2025 Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget – 7.5M ₳ for Community Builders |

- **Bundling Risk and Coordination Complexity**
  While the total requested funding (7.5M ₳) is relatively small, bundling proposals into a single governance action introduces risk. As the number of projects grouped together increases, so does the complexity of coordinating delivery timelines, reporting standards, and fund oversight. This approach may set an undesirable examples for future governance actions.
- **Support for the Projects, But Reservations on Process**
  We recognize the significance of the included projects and the strong community support they’ve received during prior temperature checks.
- **Lack of Constitutional Compliance on Oversight**
  The proposal does not meet the oversight standards required by the **Cardano Constitution, Article IV, Section 2.**
  It fails to outline any type of administrator or process for how oversight would be carried out.
  Due to the unresolved constitutional and structural concerns, we are unable to vote yes on the proposal in its current form. We would welcome a revised submission that provides clearer oversight mechanisms and better aligns with governance expectations.
