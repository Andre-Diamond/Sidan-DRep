        "content": "\r\n\r\nDear reviewer,\r\n\r\nFirst of all, it is highly unrecommended to leave any subjective argument (point 1) as part of the rejection reason. Please remember that you are representing the community in reviewing our milestone. Our team does not expect the commitment of a prototype for this milestone and has just tried to quickly compose the prototype source code to fulfill the extra delivery request as per the last comment.\r\n\r\nIn the current dispute, we have reached out team at IOG, Emurgo, and community members such as Cardano Ambassadors. We acknowledge that the dispute comes from the milestone expectation difference that in current F11: Cardano Use Cases: Concept each project should deliver a prototype as the project output. While at the beginning our team was not aware of this category's overall expectation. That’s why we have not written/proposed any commitment to building a prototype anywhere in the project milestone outputs/acceptance criteria and evidence. However, summarizing all the comments we obtained from multiple channels:\r\n\r\n1. We all agree that the Catalyst process follows the philosophy of liquid democracy, where each participant shares distinct responsibilities depending on the roles\r\n2. ADA holders have the responsibility to conduct due diligence on each project and team to cast their votes.\r\n3. The project team has the responsibility to define the project scope and propose milestone outputs/acceptance criteria and evidence.\r\n4. Reviewers have the responsibility to safeguard whether the suggested milestone outputs/acceptance criteria and evidence fulfilled the objective and direction of the fund and help revise or approve the milestone outputs/acceptance criteria and evidence as it find fit.\r\n5. The project team has the responsibility to provide evidence of achievement.\r\n6. Reviewers have the responsibility to ensure that the evidence of achievement is submitted adequately.\r\n  \r\nCurrently, we are stuck at step 6. As we might agree that the term “feasibility report” is too vague to judge, we would argue that all the dispute stems from the failure of reviewers’ responsibility back in step 4.\r\n\r\nTo be 100% transparent, our team has proceeded to build a startup - DeltaDeFi on top of the findings from this project. We are working on a production-grade product right now so we do not have anything as a “prototype” internally. As a business, we also do not feel comfortable to open sourcing anything beyond what we have committed.\r\n\r\nAs veterans in the Cardano community, we all act for the good of the community. We are happy to share the know-how to foster growth, but it should not extend to sharing also business logic source code like how we save data fields in the database to protect ourselves as a business. A simple metaphor, Terraform got its open source version and hosted version for business, and they would never make their source code for hosted service public. I want to communicate this point very clearly.\r\n\r\nSo looking back at what we have committed in the current proposal, there is nothing about the source code we committed at the time of writing the proposal. Please respect our commitment. We are more than happy to share more with the community, so that’s what we have planned for the future funding round.\r\n\r\nTo follow up, I acknowledge the purpose of F11: Cardano Use Cases: Concept wishing to have a prototype somewhere. We might produce a more in-depth example in terms of it WITHOUT directly disclosing everything we have at DeltaDeFi (once again because it is out of scope). Since currently it is not included anywhere in our committed milestone outputs/acceptance criteria and evidence, we are also open to aligning a video call to adjust the milestone outputs/acceptance criteria and evidence for the remaining, and see how we can add this back somewhere, as a remedy of both our fault - we overlooked/misinterpreted the F11: Cardano Use Cases: Concept output goal at the beginning & reviewer mishandled milestone setting process (step 4).\r\n\r\nThis is a very good case study of demonstrating exhausting miscommunication that could happen on Catalyst so we proceed with leaving comments in the current resubmission to leave the data permanent for future study.\r\n\r\nThanks & let’s make the system better together.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nSIDAN Lab team\r\n\r\nResubmission:\r\n\r\n- Whitepaper: https://docs.google.com/document/d/160s5O5JLdGFocVzD4aX97UEP1afa1I6G0lTeEvItl3g/edit?usp=drive_link\r\n- Team Video: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OZFqqs3Une7D1eg6B3Uc2_4Vr2OQBS8d/view?usp=drive_link\r\n- Extra evidence - feasibility study: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZjGNYmoPGTtMpYsQIEFwmtdGG9o3idirNZt0VmTgIoM/edit?usp=drive_link\r\n- Extra delivery and evidence - HFT tx chaining prototype code base - https://github.com/deltadefi-protocol/hft-tx-chaining-prototype (deployed at - https://hft-tx-chaining-prototype.vercel.app/)\r\n- Extra delivery and evidence - HFT smart contract prototype - https://github.com/deltadefi-protocol/hft-aiken-prototype\r\n",

A link will be provided. \r\n\r\nTo the reviewer who rejected. The term above refers to documented and uploaded event videos OR photos, which is referring to either one option, photos or video, would be sufficient. The reason why we mentioned this as the legal clause in Hong Kong might not allow us to share the video. Therefore, to play safe, that's why we added the option of Photos in case if there are any possible legal issues. The purpose of the photos OR videos is to prove that our hackathon took place. We hope you could understand the situation. Furthermore, the whole developer series progress and photos are announced in SIDAN Lab Twitter, as professors from official universities in Hong Kong are invited as well. (Also the videos are already in the folders of the link provided. It would make no difference whether it is in Google Drive or Youtube as long as the evidence showed that the hackathon is completed, and the file is publicly available). Hugely appreciated for understanding\r\n- Photos of Hackathon: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VHZntqCyr7czypxHt1wKICGHh63YHnq5?usp=sharing\r\n  \r\nTransaction records of kickstarting prices will be provided.

To address your concerns, here's the reply:\r\n\r\n1. 1 ADA was sent to the wallet address of each participant to ensure they received the ADA and that the wallet provided by them was correct.\r\n2. the amount of ADA transferred depends on the price of ADA during the date and time when we transferred. Therefore together with the 1 ADA, the exact amount of ADA equivalent to the USD value was sent to each winner.\r\n3. We have clearly mentioned in the T&C of our hackathon and the participants all agreed to these terms prior to the hackathon.\r\n4. One team (SwapSphere) request to split the winning reward into 2 separate wallet\r\n   \r\nAttaching the email conversation record and T&C for your reference. The T&C is attached above already.\r\n- https://adastat.net/transactions/da8c599be9de22b01822653889e45049cd1d3cc5bafb6a7c37e96493f408b170\r\n- Propbid Email: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h10zSYqcYogKaubPS24nTqHEQuW6XEwl/view?usp=sharing\r\n- Remobile Email: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AKaKFIbNy4LxlAKsgnfjUcBLvVP1CIXQ/view?usp=sharing\r\n- SwapSphere Email: https://drive.google.com/file/d/11k9fNkNblj-__Gtf-MDgXu-HdWYM8Jyj/view?usp=sharing\r\n- SwapSphere Request: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w2j3--u8k_7ogFvNLLXvwCePsMw9Jx6C/view?usp=sharing\r\n  \r\nClose-out report: \r\n- https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rkJtw1-zfHA6lG8Ew0pR0F7r4Os70-MrX7QDUqlQZaM/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nClose-out video: \r\n- https://youtu.be/H_8vhu0QoW8\r\n\r\nAs there is a screen sharing issue, here is the supplement of the screen sharing part showcasing the material we built:\r\n\r\n- Close-out video additional info: https://youtu.be/bmgdgH6CN18\r\n\r\nTo the reviewer who rejected our submission, it would be great if you could indicate when and which part of POA we mentioned we need to provide an interview video for the first-prize winning team.

One of the feedbacks we got from our virtual or offline event is that Hong Kong users want to know what is happening in the ecosystem. What dapps are built on Cardano. That's why we host this F12 Ideafest to let the HK user know. That's also why we put down \"revised Cardano ecosystem series as we will constantly provide updates and the objective is to quickly let people know about the ecosystem development, not limited to the deck only otherwise we are very slow compared with Ethereum and Solana pace in Hong Kong.\r\n\r\n> Note: Thank you for the reviewer to provide guidelines or raise any questions in the review process.\r\n\r\n- https://x.com/sidan_lab/status/1808817394514866510\r\n- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S85AgCAmWHrSknbvGKE4Nr2NpSKsUlMl/view?usp=drive_link\r\n- https://t.me/CardanoHongKongOfficial/260/391\r\n- https://www.youtube.com/live/Ej7LkpdP-M8?si=m5M3V57IA3aeZttU\r\n -https://discord.com/channels/1166784293805228061/1197474184809431101/1260203674274369627\r\n\r\nHost 1 business workshop covering the revised Cardano ecosystem, showcasing Defy, xcube.co, Meshjs, DeltaDeFi Applications and logics during the session.\r\n- https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PcrVP46nRnIhye1oXMQ355RqndSK8RpP?usp=drive_link\r\n- https://t.me/CardanoHongKongOfficial/260/344\r\n- https://discord.com/channels/1166784293805228061/1197474184809431101/1263435760003186699\r\n\r\nScreenshot of Discord Announcement:\r\n- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CBZ1CY0Axssc0HZIke2awI_SCxG-KtKu/view?usp=drive_link\r\n\r\nLastly, we want to show our huge appreciation for the effort and advice that our reviewer provided.

Please let me know if there is any misunderstanding here. Thanks a lot!\r\n\r\nRegarding feedback from catalyst team on milestone 4, please find below responses::\r\n\r\nRegarding the documentation of the API related to overview of the API, endpoint description, usage instructions, and examples, I have revised the swagger.yaml file to supplement all these information. The revised swagger.yaml file includes below information for each api function:\r\n\r\n- API path e.g. /accounts/signin\r\n- API method e.g. post\r\n- Summary (A short sentence summarising the api objective)\r\n- Description (A short paragraph illustrating the api usage instructions)\r\n- Parameter (if the api requires request parameter, the swagger doc illustrates the data type and provide an example of it)\r\n- responses (The swagger doc illustrate the example response of successful and unsuccessful api request)\r\n- Schema of the parameters are shown in the swagger doc as well\r\n\r\nRegarding the documentation of the public repository, I have revised the readme.file to reflect the overview of the repo. It should be sufficient enough for public users to understand the repo structure and navigate the repo efficiently to utilize the api functions.\r\n\r\nPlease find the revised materials in:\r\n- swagger.yaml file: https://github.com/deltadefi-protocol/deltadefi-backend/blob/master/internal/api/swagger.yaml\r\n- readme file: https://github.com/deltadefi-protocol/deltadefi-backend/tree/master\r\n",

These transaction building is used to support frameworks and projects that has not have access to cardano serialization where developers / projects can define a certain JSON format, to build those transactions.)\r\n\r\nTo create user-define transaction is easy. User simply define the custom transaction in the form of JSON. Our hosted endpoint will convert the JSON to a valid Cardano transaction and return the transaction CBOR. This is useful for developers who wants to build transactions on any platform and this method does not need to integrate with any Cardano library.\r\n\r\nFor instance, developers create a transaction defined in JSON like:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"inputs\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"type\": \"PubKey\",\r\n      \"txIn\": {\r\n        \"txHash\": \"e93177a68356dc4bfdec2ec8ac48efe4c43c2d8a5fa8a9ebbc4437943c695438\",\r\n        \"txIndex\": 0,\r\n        \"amount\": [{ \"unit\": \"lovelace\", \"quantity\": \"2833223\" }],\r\n        \"address\": \"addr_test1qr3a9rrclgf9rx90lmll2qnfzfwgrw35ukvgjrk36pmlzu0jemqwylc286744g0tnqkrvu0dkl8r48k0upkfmg7mncpqf0672w\"\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"type\": \"PubKey\",\r\n      \"txIn\": {\r\n        \"txHash\": \"fb9324c5461693f729b0a7fdab1646a79b8f439b50dc9bc85458d3ee1ca2b40b\",\r\n        \"txIndex\": 0,\r\n        \"amount\": [{ \"unit\": \"lovelace\", \"quantity\": \"2306918390\" }],\r\n        \"address\": \"addr_test1qr3a9rrclgf9rx90lmll2qnfzfwgrw35ukvgjrk36pmlzu0jemqwylc286744g0tnqkrvu0dkl8r48k0upkfmg7mncpqf0672w\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  \"changeAddress\": \"addr_test1qr3a9rrclgf9rx90lmll2qnfzfwgrw35ukvgjrk36pmlzu0jemqwylc286744g0tnqkrvu0dkl8r48k0upkfmg7mncpqf0672w\",\r\n  \"selectionConfig\": {\r\n    \"threshold\": \"0\",\r\n    \"strategy\": \"experimental\",\r\n    \"includeTxFees\": true\r\n  },\r\n  \"network\": \"preprod\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd post the data to the endpoint, [https://cloud.meshjs.dev/transaction](https://cloud.meshjs.dev/transaction) with the JSON payload.

Here we are, reporting on the successful completion of Milestone 3. We got into quite some delay, but, here we are catching up.\r\n\r\n- https://milestones.projectcatalyst.io/projects/1200202/milestones/3\r\n\r\nObjective: To introduce customized protocol parameters feature with the parallel Cardano blockchain\r\n\r\n### Acceptance criteria\r\nResearch and develop the approach to exposing altering protocol parameters at the time of starting the parallel Cardano network (e.g. fees and stakepools keys rotation)\r\nUpgrade MeshJS to support customized protocol parameters\r\n\r\n### Evidence of milestone completion\r\nA markdown file in the public Github repository, stating the exact flow of starting the network, building transaction and submitting transaction with customized protocol parameters.\r\nA published meshsdk/core node module public visitable in on npm registry with documentation on how to interact with customized protocol parameter\r\n\r\n### Report\r\nAnd here the successful completed developments of the milestone deliverables:\r\n\r\nMeshJS has been updated to support customized protocol parameters, it can be easily done by doing:\r\n\r\nconst provider = new YaciProvider(\"YACI_URL\");\r\nconst pp = await provider.fetchProtocolParameters();\r\n\r\nconst txBuilder = new MeshTxBuilder({\r\n  fetcher: provider,\r\n  params: pp,\r\n});\r\n\r\n\r\nHere we use the YaciProvider to query Yaci instance, and get the protocol parameters, then we pass it to the MeshTxBuilder. See docs: https://meshjs.dev/apis/txbuilder/basics#customProtocolParameter\r\n\r\nThe flow to starting network and building transaction with customized protocol parameters is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. start a devnet with zero fees, run the following command from yaci-cli: yaci-cli:>create-node -o --genesis-profile zero_fee --start\r\n2. start a devnet with 30 slots per epoch, run the following command from yaci-cli: yaci-cli:>create-node -o -e 30 --start\r\n3. if you want to perform more configuration to the devnet, go to config/node.properties and make changes to the properties file, then run the following command from yaci-cli: yaci-cli:>create-node -o --start\r\n\r\nThese steps are also documented and described on our Mesh website at: https://meshjs.dev/yaci/getting-started#start\r\n\r\nYou can find more detailed track records of the development at the respective github files at: https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh/tree/main/apps/playground/src/pages/yaci\r\n\r\nAll code is fully open source, you can find the respective open source license at: https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh?tab=Apache-2.0-1-ov-file#readme\r\n\r\nAnd thats it for this Milestone. We are also finishing Milestone 4 which we will submit once Milestone 3 has been reviewed and accepted.\r\n",
