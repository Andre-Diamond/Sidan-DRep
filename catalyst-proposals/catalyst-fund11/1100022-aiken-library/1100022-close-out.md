## Challenge KPIs and How the Project Addressed Them

| **Challenge KPIs**                              | **Project Deliverables** |
|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| More open-source projects, developers, and users | We delivered 9 smart contracts in the open-source MeshJS GitHub library, which are already being adopted by developers across the Cardano ecosystem. |
| More open-source tools and frameworks            | The contracts are not standalone — each comes with Aiken workspace, MeshJS components, demos, and documentation — expanding the Mesh SDK toolkit. |
| Increased open-source contributions and maintainers | Collaboration across three independent open-source teams (TrustLevel, MeshJS, and Sidan Lab) enhanced contributions and documentation quality. |
| Improved adoption of Cardano technology          | The project breaks down adoption barriers by providing starter templates, bad contract examples, and well-structured learning paths via MeshJS.dev. |

## Project KPIs and How the Project Addressed Them

| **Project KPIs**         | **Project Deliverables** |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Increased Adoption        | We created clear, accessible, and fully working examples of dApps on Cardano using Aiken and MeshJS, attracting both new and experienced developers. |
| Improved Documentation    | Each contract is accompanied by detailed usage documentation, demos, and source code—available publicly at [docs.meshjs.dev/contracts](https://docs.meshjs.dev/contracts). |
| Framework Adoption        | By integrating our contracts directly into MeshJS, a well-known developer framework, we’ve streamlined dApp development on Cardano. |
| Reputability              | We’ve built trust in Cardano tooling by open-sourcing every step, and our GitHub repositories are now widely referenced within the ecosystem. |

## Key Achievements (Collaboration & Engagement)

For this project, three different teams came together:  
**TrustLevel** (with Dominik & Team),  
**SidanLab** (with Hinson & Team), and  
**MeshJS** (with Jingles & Team),  

Each contributed their strengths in community building, smart contract engineering, and developer tooling.

MeshJS has grown significantly over the past year and is now one of the most well-known developer tools in the ecosystem:

- Released and documented a full suite of contracts including marketplace, escrow, swap, gift card, vesting, oracle patterns, and intentionally “bad” contracts for education.
- Created demos for each contract to engage and educate developers in a hands-on manner.
- Promoted the library via the MeshJS X channel: [https://x.com/meshsdk](https://x.com/meshsdk)

---

## Key Learnings

- Developers greatly benefit from seeing not only well-designed contracts but also common mistakes. The “bad contracts” helped developers learn what **not** to do. We also gave a guest lecture at the **AIKEN PBL COURSE** by **Andamio** and integrated this into the curriculum.
- Providing **working end-to-end examples** (including front-end integration, documentation, and tests) was essential for real-world usability and adoption.
- Collaborating across teams with different specialties (AI, smart contracts, community, tooling) enriched the final outputs and created synergies.

---

## Next Steps

The team is committed to continuously improving and expanding the smart contract library.  
We will:

- Actively maintain and update the contracts with Aiken upgrades and new design patterns.
- Promote MeshJS usage via guides, hackathons, and educational content.
- Consider implementing a **community bug bounty program** to allow external devs to propose and submit new contract ideas and improvements.

## Final Thoughts / Comments

We are super grateful for the support from the Cardano community, voting us **#4 in the Developer Ecosystem Challenge** in Fund 11.  
We hope this project has not only met but exceeded expectations. The momentum created through this collaboration has positioned **MeshJS** as one of the most recognized dev tools in Cardano.
