## [SOLUTION]

### Extended Problem Statement

Without an open-source smart contract library, developers face several challenges:

- **Lack of Code Examples and Best Practices**
- **Increased Development Time**
- **Security Risks**
- **Reinventing the Wheel**
- **Limited Community Support**
- **Slower Adoption and Innovation**

### Proposed Solution

**Aiken Open-Source Smart Contract Library**

- Integrated into the Mesh Github library: https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh/tree/main/packages/contracts
- Facilitates easy dApp development on Cardano.
- Includes contracts, Aiken workspace, exported blueprint, and Mesh TX builder components.

#### 1. List of ‘Standard’ Contracts

- Marketplace (buy, update, cancel, purchase)
- Swap (deposit, cancel)
- Escrow (list, pay, report, dispute, claim)
