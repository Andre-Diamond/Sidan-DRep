# Milestone Report
Dear MR,
we’ve updated the repository to address your requested changes:

### 1. Documentation & Demo Links:
Each of the five “Bad Contracts” includes a README with:

- A warning that this contract is part of the List of Bad Contracts, created for educational purposes.
- Direct links to both workshop recordings where we demonstrate and explain these contracts in detail.
- Additional documentation about:
-- The working mechanism of each error.
-- Detailed source code illustrating how to fix the error.
-- Evidence of contract testing by using the command “aiken check”.
  
### 2. Workshops
Both workshops go into detail on how to analyze and learn from these contracts. In addition they are embedded in the Gimbalabs & Andamio Aiken Learning Course, which provides additional structure and context for developers:
