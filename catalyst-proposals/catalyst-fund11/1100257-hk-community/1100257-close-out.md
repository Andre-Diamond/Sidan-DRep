## List of challenge KPIs and how the project addressed them  

The proposal should last 12 months to complete however our team managed to complete it using 6 months.  

Organising 20 quality events (18 Virtual+Workshop+Offline events + 2 university tours) is an extremely hard challenge however we managed to complete all of them.  

From the spending & evaluation report, the hiring costs, rental costs, costs of events are high due to the nature of Hong Kong living costs are high.  

To achieve all these impossibilities and challenges, there are several reasons for this:  
- We are extremely efficient in organization and operations.  
- We know Hong Kongers love to attend business workshops and networking events on the same day.  
- We review marketing strategies, event logistics, participant feedback, and budgeting from time to time.  
- We negotiate with the space owner by offering package deals.  
- We hire part-time event coordinators and volunteers  
- We reached out to student associations to increase student reach out rate

## List of project KPIs and how the project addressed them  

### List of KPIs:  
- 6 Virtual events  
- 6 Workshops  
- 6 Offline events  
- 2 University tours  
- Course material  

We managed to organize all the events by squeezing into a tight and packed schedule. However, this must be well managed otherwise the quality of the event would be low.  
To ensure the quality and the delivery of the event, our team separated into two teams, event management and project management team.  
- The event team is responsible for all the event logistics such as negotiation, event space hunting, material preparation, etc.  
- The project management team is responsible for arranging event dates, building partnerships, securing speakers for event panels, reaching out to new users and developers, etc.  

With this combination, we managed to deliver all events with high standards of content.

## Key learnings  

- Setup refundable entry cost to reduce the chance of participant no-show at the last minute  
- Offline events show-up rate is about 63% conversion from registration  
- Virtual events are less popular than offline events or workshops in terms of participation and reach-out rate  
- Organise networking events after workshop is popular and welcome in HK  
- Avoid working with universities during July and August as most the staff are on leave  
- Book multiple slots in the same event space to get the discount price which is not listed on the official channel
