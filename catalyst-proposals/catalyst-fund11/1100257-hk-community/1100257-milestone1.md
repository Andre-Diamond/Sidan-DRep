> MENTIONED IN "EVIDENCE OF MILESTONE COMPLETION"

Note 1: Some entities may not have a company structure setup due to the nature of the organization, such as DAOs, student associations, student groups, and small group study groups, therefore they may not be able to sign a partnership agreement. For ANY entities that failed to sign the partnership agreement, we will ask them to post the collaboration event or announcement on their OFFICIAL OFFICIAL PUBLIC CHANNEL (Discord OR Telegram OR Instagram OR Website) to publicly verify our collaboration.

Note 2: Some entities may not want to disclose the agreement due to a non-disclosure agreement. This is a very common practice in the business world in Hong Kong. For these entities, we will ask them to post the collaboration event or announcement on their OFFICIAL PUBLIC CHANNEL (Discord OR Telegram OR Instagram OR Website)  to publicly verify our collaboration
