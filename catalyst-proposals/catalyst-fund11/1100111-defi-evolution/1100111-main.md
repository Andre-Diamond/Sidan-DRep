# Project Proposal: HFT Framework Research for Cardano

## [GENERAL]

**Name and surname of main applicant**  
SIDAN Lab

**Are you delivering this project as an individual or as an entity (whether formally incorporated or not)**  
Entity (Incorporated)

**Please specify how many months you expect your project to last (from 2–12 months)**  
4

**Please indicate if your proposal has been auto-translated into English from another language.**  
No

**Summarize your solution to the problem (200-character limit including spaces)**  
Research and ideation on a general HFT Framework for the Cardano Blockchain to enable initial foundational groundwork for later development.

**Does your project have any dependencies on other organizations, technical or otherwise?**  
Yes

**If YES, please describe what the dependency is and why you believe it is essential for your project’s delivery.**  
Technique for transaction chaining. Adopting this technique could solve one of the HFT’s pain points - confidence on order execution at match. Also it closes the attack vector on orders frontrunning.

**Will your project’s output/s be fully open source?**  
Yes

**Please provide here more information on the open source status of your project outputs**  
All the research outcomes will be fully open sourced once the R&D is finalised.

## [SOLUTION]

### Objective

Integrate High-Frequency Trading (HFT) into Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem to increase DEX trading volume.

### Why

- **Market Gap**: Untapped HFT opportunities
- **Growth Potential**: Bridge gap between CEX and DEX
- **Ecosystem Benefit**: Liquidity, tighter spreads, valuation boost
- **Trader Adoption**: Institutions and pros need HFT on Cardano

### How

- **Security & Speed**: Research secure, fast transaction mechanisms
- **Lower Costs**: Off-chain order layer research
- **Fair Fulfillment**: Design mechanisms for fair order execution
- **Programmatic Access**: Explore APIs/SDKs for HFT
- **Non-Custodial**: Research smart contracts for fund protection
