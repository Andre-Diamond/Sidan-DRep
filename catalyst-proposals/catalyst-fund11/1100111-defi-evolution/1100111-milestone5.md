# Milestone Report

	
We would like to show huge appreciation for all the reviewers' efforts. Thank you for your contribution. 

To the reviewer who rejected our POA, the findings we got are not just a couple of sentences. The objective of the report is to provide a summary of our work in this proposal. We provide a range of findings/insights/feasibilities from business, product, and technical angles. We also provided a demo video: https://youtu.be/gJ9mYrN7bmU to demonstrate the finding results, which is included in the report. The close-out report is separated from the consolidation final report as the close-out report is mostly the requirement from the project catalyst. For simplicity and clarity, we just separated them
