# Milestone Report


Dear reviewer,

First of all, it is highly unrecommended to leave any subjective argument (point 1) as part of the rejection reason. Please remember that you are representing the community in reviewing our milestone. Our team does not expect the commitment of a prototype for this milestone and has just tried to quickly compose the prototype source code to fulfill the extra delivery request as per the last comment.

In the current dispute, we have reached out team at IOG, Emurgo, and community members such as Cardano Ambassadors. We acknowledge that the dispute comes from the milestone expectation difference that in current F11: Cardano Use Cases: Concept each project should deliver a prototype as the project output. While at the beginning our team was not aware of this category's overall expectation. That’s why we have not written/proposed any commitment to building a prototype anywhere in the project milestone outputs/acceptance criteria and evidence. However, summarizing all the comments we obtained from multiple channels:

1. We all agree that the Catalyst process follows the philosophy of liquid democracy, where each participant shares distinct responsibilities depending on the roles
2. ADA holders have the responsibility to conduct due diligence on each project and team to cast their votes.
3. The project team has the responsibility to define the project scope and propose milestone outputs/acceptance criteria and evidence.
4. Reviewers have the responsibility to safeguard whether the suggested milestone outputs/acceptance criteria and evidence fulfilled the objective and direction of the fund and help revise or approve the milestone outputs/acceptance criteria and evidence as it find fit.
5. The project team has the responsibility to provide evidence of achievement.
6. Reviewers have the responsibility to ensure that the evidence of achievement is submitted adequately.
  
Currently, we are stuck at step 6. As we might agree that the term “feasibility report” is too vague to judge, we would argue that all the dispute stems from the failure of reviewers’ responsibility back in step 4.

To be 100% transparent, our team has proceeded to build a startup - DeltaDeFi on top of the findings from this project. We are working on a production-grade product right now so we do not have anything as a “prototype” internally. As a business, we also do not feel comfortable to open sourcing anything beyond what we have committed.

As veterans in the Cardano community, we all act for the good of the community. We are happy to share the know-how to foster growth, but it should not extend to sharing also business logic source code like how we save data fields in the database to protect ourselves as a business. A simple metaphor, Terraform got its open source version and hosted version for business, and they would never make their source code for hosted service public. I want to communicate this point very clearly.

So looking back at what we have committed in the current proposal, there is nothing about the source code we committed at the time of writing the proposal. Please respect our commitment. We are more than happy to share more with the community, so that’s what we have planned for the future funding round.

To follow up, I acknowledge the purpose of F11: Cardano Use Cases: Concept wishing to have a prototype somewhere. We might produce a more in-depth example in terms of it WITHOUT directly disclosing everything we have at DeltaDeFi (once again because it is out of scope). Since currently it is not included anywhere in our committed milestone outputs/acceptance criteria and evidence, we are also open to aligning a video call to adjust the milestone outputs/acceptance criteria and evidence for the remaining, and see how we can add this back somewhere, as a remedy of both our fault - we overlooked/misinterpreted the F11: Cardano Use Cases: Concept output goal at the beginning & reviewer mishandled milestone setting process (step 4).

This is a very good case study of demonstrating exhausting miscommunication that could happen on Catalyst so we proceed with leaving comments in the current resubmission to leave the data permanent for future study.

Thanks & let’s make the system better together.

Best,

SIDAN Lab team
