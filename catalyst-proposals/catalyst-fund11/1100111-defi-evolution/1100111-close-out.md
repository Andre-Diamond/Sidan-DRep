## List of challenge KPIs and how the project addressed them

As outlined in the Campaign Brief,  
The Cardano Use Cases: Concept category is aimed towards projects seeking to develop early stage ideas that will deliver proof of concept, design research and basic prototyping for innovative Cardano-based products, services, and business models.

We are delivering research and ideation on a general HFT Framework for the Cardano Blockchain to enable initial foundational groundwork for later development. List of challenges that we face:

- **Scalability and Transaction Speed:** With the limitation of order management costs and UTxO architecture, it presents challenges in supporting high-frequency transactions efficiently.  
- **UTxO Contention:** Managing UTxOs efficiently in high-frequency trading environments is challenging, especially when concurrent actions from multiple users or the protocol itself lead to UTxO contention.  
- **Order Matching and Execution Fairness:** Ensuring fairness in order matching and execution, particularly under conditions of high traffic, is critical for the credibility of the platform.  
- **Non-Custodial Fund Security:** One of the primary challenges DeltaDeFi faces is ensuring non-custodial fund security while maintaining a smooth user experience.  

**How we addressed the challenge:**

- **Optimising for Security and Speed:** Research a mechanism enhanced transaction speed and reliability, tailored for the high demands of High-Frequency Trading.  
- **Lower Order Management Costs:** Research an off-chain order layer to remove order management costs.  
- **Fair Order Fulfilment:** Research a mechanism that ensures fairness in order fulfilment while leveraging the power of off-chain computation.  
- **Programmatic Access:** Research the possibility of APIs & SDKs for users to enable high frequency trading and attract professional and institutional traders.  
- **Fully Non-Custodial:** Utility research of Cardano smart contract to protect users’ funds

## Key learnings

**Utilise resources:**  
Our manpower and funds are very limited. We need to outline and structure carefully. We completed and we will continue to plan for all the upcoming activities coming forward.

**Avoid exhaustive communication**  
We provided additional or extra delivery at the request of the reviewer. For the upcoming proposals, we will be more aware of expectation settings.

## Next steps for the product or service developed

- Continue on DeltaDeFi MVP development  
- Continue on DeltaDeFi open-source development  
- Collect community and enterprise feedback

## Final thoughts/comments

We are delighted to get funded by project catalyst to start researching HFT integration into Cardano DeFi. We want to bring in more liquidity, institution players to the ecosystem. Identifying the busines, product and technical feasibility, we are certain that HFT is crucial to the growth of activities in DeFi.  
Moving forward, we will build DeltaDeFi’s MVP and open-source it. Stay tuned for more
