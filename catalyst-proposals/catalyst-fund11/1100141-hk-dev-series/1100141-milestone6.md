Recorded and uploaded Event Videos/Photos to YouTube. A link will be provided. 

To the reviewer who rejected. The term above refers to documented and uploaded event videos OR photos, which is referring to either one option, photos or video, would be sufficient. The reason why we mentioned this as the legal clause in Hong Kong might not allow us to share the video. Therefore, to play safe, that's why we added the option of Photos in case if there are any possible legal issues. The purpose of the photos OR videos is to prove that our hackathon took place. We hope you could understand the situation. Furthermore, the whole developer series progress and photos are announced in SIDAN Lab Twitter, as professors from official universities in Hong Kong are invited as well. (Also the videos are already in the folders of the link provided. It would make no difference whether it is in Google Drive or Youtube as long as the evidence showed that the hackathon is completed, and the file is publicly available). Hugely appreciated for understanding

Transaction records of kickstarting prices will be provided. A link of transaction. 

Thank you for the inquiry reviewer. To address your concerns, here's the reply:

1. 1 ADA was sent to the wallet address of each participant to ensure they received the ADA and that the wallet provided by them was correct.
2. the amount of ADA transferred depends on the price of ADA during the date and time when we transferred. Therefore together with the 1 ADA, the exact amount of ADA equivalent to the USD value was sent to each winner.
3. We have clearly mentioned in the T&C of our hackathon and the participants all agreed to these terms prior to the hackathon.
4. One team (SwapSphere) request to split the winning reward into 2 separate wallet
   
Attaching the email conversation record and T&C for your reference. The T&C is attached above already.

To the reviewer who rejected our submission, it would be great if you could indicate when and which part of POA we mentioned we need to provide an interview video for the first-prize winning team. Thank you very much and appreciate a lot the effort. If that's the case we will contact the winning team to get their agreement.
