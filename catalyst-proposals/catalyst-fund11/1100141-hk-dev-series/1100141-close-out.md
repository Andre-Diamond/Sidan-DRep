## List of challenge KPIs and how the project addressed them

As outlined in the Campaign Brief,  
Cardano Open: Developers (technical track) category aims to support developers and engineers to contribute to or develop open source technology centered around enabling and improving the Cardano developer experience.  
The goal of this category is to create developer-friendly tooling and approaches that streamline an integrated development environment, help to create code more efficiently and provide an ease of use for developers.

We are delivering a comprehensive developer series designed to cultivate Cardano talents and innovation in Hong Kong. Leveraging our development experience in multiple reputable Cardano projects, along with our extensive network - local network with SIDAN Lab and Waffle Capital; globally diverse network with Gimbalabs and Genius X - we will offer in-depth workshops, practical bootcamps, and a hackathon.

**Key components include:**

- **Technical Workshops and Bootcamps:** Utilizing the existing open-source content and resources from Gimbalabs, MeshJS (an open source Cardano development SDK) and our own expertise at SIDAN Lab, these sessions will cover topics from basic blockchain principles to advanced Cardano-specific development skills.  
- **Hackathon and Project Incubation:** Participants will apply their learning to develop real-world applications on the Cardano blockchain in a hackathon. In partnership with Genius X and Waffle Capital, promising candidates would have the opportunity to bring their ideas to the real world with aid from Genius X’s accelerator program and potential investment from Waffle Capital.  
- **Business Seminars:** Addressing the non-technical aspects of blockchain innovation, these seminars provided by Genius X will cover legal, marketing, and tokenomics, essential for successful blockchain startups.

## Key achievements (in particular around collaboration and engagement)

Cardano in Hong Kong got very low exposure. Students do not know about Cardano and do not know how to participate in learning any blockchain technology development. Here is what we achieved:

- Complete AikenPBL, MeshPBL, HKPBL, AikenPBL which can be scalable and reused for other countries using Andamio  
- Developer series registration participant reached 55  
- Built a partnership with AWS for event support  
- Built partnerships with 4 student society in Hong Kong  

---

## Key learnings

- The time and cost of writing courses is more than we considered.  
- The venue cost is huge in Hong Kong  
- The student groups are more active than we estimated  
- Finance experts with or without computer science background can learn the course within 3 days  

---

## Next steps for the product or service developed

- Continue to update course material  
- Answer any enquiry from the winning team in the Hackathon  

---

## Final thoughts/comments

We are delighted to onboard more new developers to Cardano. The preparation of the cost material took longer than we expected however it is worth providing top-notch content for better demonstration. We managed to organize a hackathon and got some great feedback and endorsement from the professors at universities. We managed to secure a partnership from AWS and the student society to ensure the developer series run smoothly.

Moving forward, we will continue to provide support to the winning team from technical and business aspect. We will prepare for the next hackathon in Hong Kong, or maybe any other places in Asia.
