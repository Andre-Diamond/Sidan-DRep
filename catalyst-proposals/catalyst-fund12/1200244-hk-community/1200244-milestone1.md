Follow-up email sent to all attendees of the event (We can BCC someone from the Catalyst team as evidence). You have acknowledged receipt of this

The link to photos and videos above includes a file to the entire 45 minute panel discussion. It's also now on Youtube shared by Dapp_Central (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF8_Ca-DgME&t=215s)

Documentation proving that 5 companies participated, along with illustrative images.

Regarding this point, if you read our acceptance criteria, it clearly outlines “Number of Organizations in Crypto to join: Minimum 5”, the word participated was never mentioned and join was used to indicate attendance and networking. Images with linkedin, job title, etc added in the like below. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jZmZOnqBh9CF9vaggBgvowqaBk0Weg8fuAjlw9fobKE/edit?usp=sharing

Video Recording

The event began at 6pm and ended at 10pm

The panel ran from 7pm-8pm and guests stayed back for networking

It sounds ridiculous to record people entering and people networking so we did not do this.
