To the reviewer who rejected our milestone 1 submission,

Milestone one is mainly for the purpose of setting up an operational organization, and assigning tasks to team members. The document we provided showed all the involved team member, and the roles and responsibilities of each person, with an additional Gantt chart timeline. This showed that the tool perfectly performed what it meant to do, i.e. tracking the project's progress and disclosing the team to all community members

Ten APIs are listed in the builder folder in the Whiskey repo, and the feature targets for the SDK development are set going forward. This further showed we have completed all the commitments that we promised in milestone one. Please approve the milestone one submission
